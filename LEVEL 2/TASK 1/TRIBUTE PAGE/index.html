        <h2>Life and Career</h2>
        <p>S. Janaki, born on April 23, 1938, in Pallapatla, Repalle Taluka, Andhra Pradesh, India, is an illustrious Indian playback singer affectionately known as "Janaki Amma." Despite lacking formal training in classical music, her prodigious talent flourished. Janaki's journey commenced with her debut in the 1957 Tamil film "Vidhiyin Vilayattu," setting the stage for a remarkable career that spanned over six decades. Proficient in languages such as Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi, she showcased her versatility by recording over 48,000 songs in films, albums, TV, and radio. In 1959, she married V. Ramprasad, a supportive partner who accompanied her during most recordings until his demise in 1997.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Janaki's contribution to Malayalam cinema is particularly noteworthy, earning her the first Kerala State Film Award for Best Singer in 1970. Her command over the language and impeccable diction propelled her to great heights, becoming the most awarded non-Malayali artist in the Malayalam film industry. She received the Kerala State Film Award for Best Singer almost every year for 15 years. In 2017, Janaki marked the end of her illustrious 60-year singing career with a memorable concert in Mysuru. Notable among her many Malayalam hits are timeless solo tracks like "Mizhiyithalil" from "Onnaman" (2002) and the emotionally resonant "Amma Poovinum" from "10 Kalpanakal" (2016), showcasing her enduring impact on the industry.</p>
